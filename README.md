# ECS - Entity Component System

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/andygeiss/ecs)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/andygeiss/ecs)

**Build scalable solutions based on the Entity Component System concept in Golang**

The architectural pattern of an ECS is mostly used in game development,
to provide long-term maintainability and extendability of large, dynamic systems.

[![Overview](ecs.svg)](ecs.svg)

An **Entity** is basically a composition of different components and has an ID.  
A **Component** contains only the state or data of one specific aspect like health, position, velocity etc.  
A **System** handles the behaviour or logic of the components. A movement system uses the position and velocity to implement an entities movement.

- [Usage](README.md#usage)

## Goals

- Provide an **easy-to-use module** to create a ECS architecture.
- **No dependencies** to other modules.
- **Minimum overhead** - use only what is really needed.

## Installation

**From Source**

    go get -u github.com/Gamerfiend/ecs

## Usage
